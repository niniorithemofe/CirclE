- a circular economy focuses on reuse, reduce and recycle to manage trash pollution, while our current linear economy adopts a take, make and waste operation. currently, there exists progressive effort to reduce the weight of combusted or landfilled solid waste, however i believe the current system can be more efficient by putting more emphasis on the individual.
